Description: MANANA is the premier ecosystem on InitVerse (INIChain). The MANANA protocol is a strong example of building an on-chain Bretton Woods system. Its goal is to use the MYUSD stablecoin to absorb and convert stablecoins from all countries. This unifies the complex stablecoin market, allowing all on-chain and off-chain economic operations around the world to be settled using the MYUSD stablecoin. This includes oil trading, gold trading, carbon emissions trading, international trade, US stock tokenization, bond trading, international remittances, IoT instant payments, ID-free bank card services and lending, AI-powered settlement, native crypto trading, and more. Stablecoins will be ubiquitous and pervasive in the future. With $MYUSD, #MANANA is building a decentralized future where money from anywhere serves everyone. MANANA possesses the comprehensive compliance qualifications and regulatory guarantees required to conduct stablecoin business. MANANA FINANCE LTD, a subsidiary of the company, has obtained a US MSB (Money Services Business) license and is regulated by FinCEN (the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network). It is legally authorized to conduct currency exchange, cross-border payments, and cryptocurrency-related services, and is responsible for the issuance and circulation of the MYUSD stablecoin.

MANANA Protocol has received investment support from Mana Ventures Flock Safety, LP and has completed registration and filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), obtaining a compliant exemption for the issuance of MYUSD.

MANA MANAGEMENT LLC, as the management company, holds a Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) license, enabling it to conduct US stock investment and related asset management business in accordance with the law. '
